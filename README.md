# Odin Recipes

## Project Goal

Build a simple website that contains recipes for your favorite dishes using only HTML. This is one of the first hands-on exercises in the Foundations path of The Odin Project and will help you get comfortable with:

- Writing semantic HTML
- Structuring content across multiple pages
- Using links and images
- Organizing files and folders
